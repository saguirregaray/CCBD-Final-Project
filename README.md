## Introduction

A podcast is a series of spoken word audio episodes that focus on various topics, such as romantic stories, scientific introductions to computers, and more. However, a significant challenge in the podcast industry revolves around language imbalance. Educational podcast content, for example, predominantly exists in English, leaving minor languages underrepresented. Our project seeks to address this issue by providing users with a transcribing and translating tool.

Specifically, our system allows users to upload podcasts in any language and seamlessly convert them into their preferred language for comprehension. Additionally, users can share podcasts publicly and explore content from others through our recommendation system. Leveraging recent advancements in machine learning technologies, we ensure excellent quality in the translated audio files.

With the aid of cloud infrastructures, notably Amazon Web Services, we've engineered our platform to scale efficiently. This allows for seamless handling of podcast uploads, transcriptions, and recommendations, catering to millions of users.
